# dotfiles.git

This repository contains the ingredients for a comfortable shell environment, in the form of scripts, shell functions and options, application configuration files, and so forth.

Some of the coee may be copy-pasted and unattributed, although most is mine, sometimes embarassingly so. In any case, it's a big brain dump of how I've grown my bash profile through the years. Mostly for curiosity and getting to know me.

Much code could stand to be rewritten, but either isn't in active use, or works well as-is so I haven't bothered.
