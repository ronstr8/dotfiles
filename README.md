# dotfiles.git

This repository contains the ingredients for a comfortable shell environment, in the form of scripts, shell functions and options, application configuration file, and so forth.  Prior to becoming a version-controlled Git repo, those directories were copied to machines visited by the author-- sometimes automated by the ~/bin/ssh-init-account script.

Also included is a Makefile or build script to link the files to the locations expected by the applications consuming them.
