# dotfiles.git

This repository contains the ingredients for a comfortable shell environment, in the form of scripts, shell functions and options, application configuration files, and so forth.

Some of the code may be copy-pasted and unattributed, although most is mine, sometimes embarassingly so. In any case, it's a big brain dump of how I've grown my bash profile through the years. Mostly for curiosity and getting to know me.

I use the `session` framework regularly when using `screen` on systems. I've meant to move it to `tmux` or another more modern tool, but have had no strong reason to do so.

Much code could stand to be rewritten, but either isn't in active use, or works well as-is so I haven't bothered.
